     My name is Joseph Berglund. I'm a third-year student at Mizzou double-majoring in Physics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies. 
     This class fills a Social Science requirement, and since it's completely online, it fits my schedule well. 
     I took a web design class before I started high school, so I have forgotten most of it and am eager to learn more about it. 
     Outside of class, I work as a Physics tutor for the Learning Center here on campus. My biggest hobby is listening to music! 
     I listen to it for hours and end up not getting my work done because I get so distracted. 
     I like almost all genres of music, but some of my favorite artists are the Beach Boys, Kendrick Lamar, Queen, and Lauryn Hill. 
     I also play the piano, but I'm not very good at it. I enjoy taking walks, watching football games, and spending time with family.
